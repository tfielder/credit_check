# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
  I'm proud that I've created a working program in a language I just learned this month.
1. What do you need to improve?
  I can still work on cleaning up the code or using simpler code as I learn it.
1. What questions do you still have?
  I'm still interested in finding out some of the ins and outs of testing.  Also, is it common to chain methods to each other, or have one method that drives the program.

# Rubric

## Functionality -

Notes: Overall 2 or 3. Working through Iteration 3. Would put a 3 if I had finished through iteration 3. Iteration 2 was functional and working.

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics

Notes:  Can include better choice enumerable methods once I learn them. Accurately use flow control structures to manage the programs flow with boolean and conditional statements.  Might choose to use more instance variables, attribute accessors.

The student(s):

- [x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [x] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design

Notes: Could work on Single Responsibility and possibly improve DRY principles. Could improve on some of the naming for methods. A few methods might be able to be condensed.  I could condense some of the code.  No linter report yet.  

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [x] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [x] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing

Notes: Writing the Minitests.  Learned about testing this round so in the future I will write tests perhaps before coding.  I don't know writing integration and unit tests.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control

Notes: Can improve on incrementally committing to git and gitHub. Will need to continue to practice submitting and merging Pull Requests using the Github interface.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [x] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
